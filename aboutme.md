My name is Kamil Kmita. I hold a position of Research Assistant at Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, where I work on my PhD
in [BIPOLAR project](http://bipolar.ibspan.waw.pl/Home.html).

I would describe myself as a statistician and a data scientist with a primary focus on *healthcare data analysis*.
Having worked in the business for a couple of years, I decided to start my academic career.
Things I work on/enjoy:

- uncertainty in statistical modeling,
- programming in Python,
- monitoring of mental disorders such as bipolar disorder,
- writing scientific articles.

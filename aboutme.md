My name is Kamil Kmita. I currently hold a position of Research Assistant at Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, where I work on my PhD
project in [BIPOLAR project](http://bipolar.ibspan.waw.pl/Home.html).

# background

I would describe myself as a statistician and a data scientist with a primary focus on *healthcare data analysis*:

- a statistician, because I studied Mathematical Statistics and worked as a Senior Statistician in the pharmaceutical industry,
- a data scientist, because I worked as a Data Scientist in the consulting solving business problems.
I still have this problem-solving attitude and believe that the analytical tools serve to resolve a specific problem (that often needs to be framed first).

These two terms interleave in my opinion, but still represent different roots.
Anyway, my favourite quotation and motto says it all:

*"Statistics is more a way of thinking or reasoning than a bunch of prescriptions for beating data to elicit answers."*

# current activity

Having worked in the business for a couple of years, I decided to start my academic career.
A couple of things I work on/enjoy:

- accountig for label uncertainty in statistical modeling,
- fuzzy clustering,
- programming in Python,
- problem of health status prediction in monitoring mental disorders such as bipolar disorder,
- writing scientific articles. I've always disliked poetry, it was not my thing at all,
but now I do better understand poets and poetry readers: a good scientific article has a lot in common with a good poem.
